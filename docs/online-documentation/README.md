# Autonomi Documentation

Welcome to the Autonomi documentation… these guides will help you get started building with the Autonomi Network.

## What is Autonomi?

Autonomi is a decentralised data and communications platform designed to provide complete privacy, security, and freedom by distributing data across a peer-to-peer network, rather than relying on centralised servers. Through end-to-end encryption, self-authentication, and the allocation of storage and bandwidth from users’ own devices, it seeks to create an autonomous, self-sustaining system where data ownership remains firmly in the hands of individuals rather than corporations.

## Language Support

Autonomi provides client libraries for multiple languages:

\=== "Node.js" \`\`\`typescript import { Client } from 'autonomi';

````
const client = new Client();
await client.connect();
```
````

\=== "Python" \`\`\`python from autonomi import Client

````
client = Client()
await client.connect()
```
````

\=== "Rust" \`\`\`rust use autonomi::Client;

````
let client = Client::new()?;
```
````

## Building from Source

\=== "Python (using Maturin & uv)" \`\`\`bash # Install build dependencies curl -LsSf [https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh](https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh) | sh uv pip install maturin

````
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dirvine/autonomi.git
cd autonomi

# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Build and install the package
cd python
maturin develop

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```
````

\=== "Node.js" \`\`\`bash # Install build dependencies npm install -g node-gyp

````
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dirvine/autonomi.git
cd autonomi

# Build the Node.js bindings
cd nodejs
npm install
npm run build

# Link for local development
npm link
```
````

\=== "Rust" \`\`\`bash # Clone the repository git clone [https://github.com/dirvine/autonomi.git](https://github.com/dirvine/autonomi.git) cd autonomi

````
# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Run tests
cargo test --all-features

# Install locally
cargo install --path .
```
````
